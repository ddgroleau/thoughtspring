                    <h3>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
                    <p>
                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and 
                    mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or 
                    setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference 
                    not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored 
                    and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard 
                    for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. 
                    As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or 
                    any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice 
                    not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking 
                    is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform 
                    you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
